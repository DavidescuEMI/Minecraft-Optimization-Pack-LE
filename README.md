# Performance Tweaks :
-Disable V-Sync in settings,and move the FPS slider to Unlimited to get the maximum FPS.
-Lower down your render distance(6-8 is great)
-Lower down your graphics settings to fast
-Disable all particles and animations(and enable the ones you want)
-Allocate more or less ram in minecraft,test minecraft with different amounts of RAM and look what's the best setup for you
-If you are using an Nvidia GPU,go into nvidia control panel and turn on High Performance Mode(This option is visible to laptop users)
-Stop using shaders(if you are using one)
-Stop using high quality texture packs(Textures packs made for performance will make 0 difference for performance,atleast that's the case for me)
